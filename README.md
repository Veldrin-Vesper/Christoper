During my studies in electrical and electronics engineering at the Petroleum Training Institute, I got introduced to networking, which sparked my interest in cybersecurity. Over time, I developed a deep passion for penetration testing and ethical hacking. I’m constantly learning and improving my skills, exploring ways to secure systems and identify vulnerabilities.  

## Objective  
I’m passionate about cybersecurity, especially penetration testing, network security, and threat detection. My goal is to find and fix security weaknesses while learning more about ethical hacking, digital forensics, and security operations. Coming from an electrical and electronics engineering background, I’m always looking to improve my skills and stay ahead in cybersecurity.
